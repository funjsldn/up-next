# up-next

Our meetups have a simple structure:

- panel, or talk
- hands on coding
- sharing

Each meetup is an issue. If there's a date announced, the issue will have a date. If it has a panel label, it's a panel and we're looking for suggested questions: just make a comment on the issue. If you see a question you like, simply hit :thumbsup:! 

## Panels

Panel meetups will have an invited panel, with pre-selected questions from the audience. 

## Hands on coding

We're keen to give people a chance to try out what we hear from speakers or panels. The hands-on section is that time.

## Sharing

Share what you've made, or found out!
